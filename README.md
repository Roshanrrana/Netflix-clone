# Netflix Homepage Clone (Front-End)

This repository features a front-end clone of the Netflix homepage, meticulously crafted using **HTML** and **CSS**. The project aims to replicate the visual design, layout, and core user interface elements of the original streaming platform, providing a static, pixel-perfect representation.

## Project Highlights:

* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop displays, demonstrating proficiency with `@media` queries.

* **Accurate UI Replication:** Key UI components such as the navigation bar, hero section with featured content, and horizontal scrolling movie/show rows have been faithfully recreated.

* **CSS Layout Mastery:** Extensive use of **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for efficient and dynamic content arrangement, including complex row structures and item alignment.

* **Visual Fidelity:** Attention to detail in typography, color palette (dark backgrounds, Netflix red accents), spacing, and subtle hover effects to mimic the authentic Netflix aesthetic.

* **Pure Front-End:** This project is purely a visual design exercise. It utilizes no JavaScript for interactivity or dynamic content, focusing solely on HTML structure and CSS styling capabilities. All content is static.

## Technologies Used:

* **HTML5:** For semantic page structure.

* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.
